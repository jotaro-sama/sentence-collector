## Add new sentences

- All sentences you submit must be under [Public Domain (CC-0) license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain).
- Numbers. There should be no digits in the source text because they can cause problems when read aloud. The way a number is read depends on context and might introduce confusion in the dataset. For example, the number “2409” could be accurately read as both “twenty-four zero nine” and “two thousand four hundred nine”.
- Abbreviations and Acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling. Additionally, there may be multiple accurate readings for a single abbreviation. For example, the acronym “ICE” could be pronounced “I-C-E” or as a single word.
- Punctuation. Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”
- Foreign letters. Letters must be valid in the language being spoken. For example, “ж” is a letter in the Russian alphabet but is never used in English and so should never appear in any English source text.
- Length. Sentences must be 14 words or less.

We prefer natural/conversational sentences. While phonetic diversity and different words in sentences is important, we are trying to make recording sentences as much fun as possible. Therefore it would be great if you could try to keep your sentences as natural/engaging as possible.

## Finding existing sentences in the Public Domain

### Search for them on the internet
Remember that we need permission to publish those sentences, so always ensure that the text belongs to the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain). If there is not an indication, reach out to the person that the text belongs to and ask if you can use their text.

Here are some tips to find sentences:
- The best sources you can look for are podcasts, transcripts, movie scripts and anything that potential can contain everyday conversations.
- Government proceedings, books and articles are also great however since the text tends to be a little more formal they are less of a priority.
- Unfortunately we can’t have Wikimedia articles yet. So do not copy paste from there.

### Partner with local organizations or individuals

There are a lot of public organizations that might want to collaborate and already have a lot of texts they can donate as public domain. Reach out to local Universities, Governments and open source organizations to talk about the project and ask for their help.

Expert linguists can also help, try to reach out to local linguistic Universities (both teachers and students) and see if they can help to gather a diverse set of sound-diverse sentences in your language.
